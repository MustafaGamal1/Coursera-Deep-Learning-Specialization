# Coursera-Deep-Learning-Specialization

**Master Deep Learning, and Break into AI**

Insructor: [Andrew NG](https://www.andrewng.org/)


## About the Specialization

In five courses, you will learn the foundations of Deep Learning, understand how to build neural networks, and learn how to lead successful machine learning projects. You will learn about Convolutional networks, RNNs, LSTM, Adam, Dropout, BatchNorm, Xavier/He initialization, and more. You will work on case studies from healthcare, autonomous driving, sign language reading, music generation, and natural language processing. You will master not only the theory, but also see how it is applied in industry. You will practice all these ideas in Python and in TensorFlow.

## Respiratory Content

This repo will contains all my current work for the specialization (The courses I finished + The ones I'm currently working on).All the codes, quizes, and images taken from [Coursera-Deep-Learning-Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning).

Note: Any missing quiz or assignment will be uploaded soon as I've prepared it!.
