## Week 1 Quiz

Question 1. What does a neuron compute?


- [] A neuron computes an activation function followed by a linear function (z = Wx + b)


- [] A neuron computes a function g that scales the input x linearly (Wx + b)


- [] A neuron computes the mean of all features before applying the output to an activation function


- [] A neuron computes a linear function (z = Wx + b) followed by an activation function

Note : Correct, we generally say that the output of a neuron is a = g(Wx + b) where g is the activation function (sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, ...).
